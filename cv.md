## About Me

Programming attracted me back in my student years, when we studied the programming of microcontrollers. I liked web development for its boundlessness and the minimum of the necessary physical resources for the production of a product, in this area it is possible and necessary to constantly develop and there is no visible end. I like working in a team. My goal is to become a good front-end developer.
